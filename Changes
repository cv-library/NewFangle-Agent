Revision history for NewFangle::Agent

{{$NEXT}}

    * Fixed an issue with CLI tests that could leave stale files behind on
      failed runs.
    * Fixed an issue with the CI configuration, which made tests not run.
      Current config does not include Windows tests.
    * The `run-perl` command in `newrelic-admin` now wraps the code to execute
      in a transaction tracked in an app that is initialised according to the
      current config.

    * Fixed an issue where environment variables would only be read into
      the local config if they were truthy. This has been changed so they
      are read if they are defined.
    * Silence a warning issued by newer Perls (5.36+) for which using @_
      in a subroutine with signatures is experimental. This was being raised
      by our custom `require` which does not have a signature, but does have
      a prototype. This now uses the explicit `:prototype` trait to
      disambiguate.
    * Add tests for newrelic-admin CLI tool
    * Add version command to newrelic-admin tool

    * Refactored segment starters into packages under the
      NewFangle::Agent::SegmentStarter:: namespace
    * Removed references to NewFangle::Agent::generate_segment_starter
      from documentation, because creating packages under
      NewFangle::Agent::SegmentStarter:: namespace is the only supported way to
      add monitoring segments
    * Added Class::Load as a dependency

    * Added transaction_name as a recognised value in the Plack
      environment to override transaction names.
    * Noted possible issues with transaction grouping in the documentation
      for the Plack middleware.
    * Marked NewFangle as a required module, not just recommended
    * Clarified that the daemon host configuration key requires a
      host:port pair
    * Add tests for middleware
    * Pass env as additional parameter to default enders

    * Add a missing dependency on Hash::Merge
    * Log level checks are now done at compile time for performance
    * Trace logging is more explicit about packages that have been skipped
    * XSLoader, Plack, and Exporter are added to the list of packages
      we always skip. This was causing issues in some applications
    * Add tests for config manager
    * Fix segment starter for LWP::UserAgent::request
